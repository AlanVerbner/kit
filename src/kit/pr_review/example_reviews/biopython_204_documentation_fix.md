## PR Summary

This is a simple documentation fix that adds a correct import statement to the Biopython Structural Bioinformatics FAQ. The author experienced an error when following the documentation and fixed it by adding the proper import statement that was missing.

**Problem**: `MMCIF2Dict("5SWE.Cif")` was failing with "TypeError: 'module' object is not callable" because the import statement only imported the module, not the class.

**Solution**: Added the correct import statement to make the code examples work properly.

## Kit AI Review Output

### Priority Issues
No significant issues identified. This is a straightforward documentation improvement.

### Summary
This PR adds a correct import statement to the Biopython Structural Bioinformatics FAQ documentation. The change appears to be a minor documentation fix, adding 2 lines to clarify proper import usage for users following the FAQ guide.

Based on the file analysis showing:
- Single markdown file modified (`wiki/The_Biopython_Structural_Bioinformatics_FAQ.md`)
- 2 lines added, 0 lines removed
- No symbols or code dependencies affected

This is a low-risk documentation enhancement that should improve user experience by providing clearer import guidance.

### Recommendations

**Documentation Quality:**
- Since the actual diff content isn't accessible due to the 404 error, I recommend verifying that:
  - The import statement follows current Biopython conventions
  - The syntax is correct and tested
  - The import aligns with the specific FAQ context where it's being added

**Process Improvement:**
- Consider adding a brief comment in the PR description explaining which specific import was corrected and why, to help future maintainers understand the context

**Validation:**
- Ensure the import statement works with the current version of Biopython being documented
- Verify the import is placed in the appropriate section of the FAQ for logical flow

This appears to be a beneficial change that enhances the documentation's accuracy and user-friendliness with minimal risk.
