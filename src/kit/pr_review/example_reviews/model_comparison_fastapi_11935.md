## 📊 Detailed Model Comparisons

### 1. GPT-4.1-nano ($0.0046) - Ultra Budget

**Summary**: 
Identifies the main change as a packaging restructure but misses deeper implications.

**Issues Found (2)**:
- **Medium**: CLI error handling could be improved
- **Low**: Documentation update needed

**Review Quality**:
```
✅ Accurate basic understanding
✅ Identifies core functionality changes  
❌ Misses ecosystem impact
❌ Limited architectural analysis
❌ No cross-codebase impact discussion
```

**Sample Output**:
> "This PR changes FastAPI's installation approach, moving CLI dependencies to an optional extra. The main change allows users to install either `fastapi` (minimal) or `fastapi[standard]` (full features). Error handling in `cli.py` could use more specific exceptions."

**Best For**: High-volume minor reviews, quick sanity checks

---

### 2. GPT-4o-mini ($0.0067) - Budget

**Summary**: 
Provides good technical analysis with better context understanding than nano.

**Issues Found (4)**:
- **Medium**: Exception type could be more specific (ImportError vs RuntimeError)
- **Medium**: Test coverage could be more comprehensive  
- **Low**: Documentation consistency across tutorials
- **Low**: Migration guide would help users

**Review Quality**:
```
✅ Solid technical understanding
✅ Identifies most important changes
✅ Some ecosystem awareness
❌ Limited depth on broader implications
❌ Basic architectural analysis
```

**Sample Output**:
> "This PR introduces a significant packaging change for FastAPI, moving from batteries-included to opt-in dependencies. Key improvements needed: better exception types in CLI error handling, expanded test coverage for both installation modes, and documentation consistency across the ecosystem."

**Best For**: Highly cost-conscious teams

---

### 3. Claude Sonnet 4 ($0.0340) - Recommended ⭐

**Summary**: 
Comprehensive analysis with architectural understanding and ecosystem awareness.

**Issues Found (7)**
- **Medium**: RuntimeError should be ImportError/ModuleNotFoundError
- **Low**: Test uses coverage subprocess complexity
- **Recommendations**: Error handling, test improvements, documentation consistency, migration guide, ecosystem coordination

**Review Quality**:
```
✅ Excellent technical depth
✅ Architectural understanding
✅ Ecosystem impact analysis
✅ Concrete code suggestions  
✅ Strategic recommendations
```

**Sample Output**: *[See actual review in fastapi_11935_standard_dependencies.md]*

**Best For**: Production teams, important changes, balanced cost/quality

---

### 4. Claude Opus 4 ($0.9086) - Premium

**Summary**: 
Deep architectural analysis with comprehensive ecosystem and long-term impact assessment.

**Issues Found (10)**:
- **High**: Breaking change coordination strategy needed
- **Medium**: CLI error handling improvement (specific exception types)
- **Medium**: Test coverage gaps in both installation modes
- **Medium**: Documentation migration complexity
- **Low**: Packaging validation for edge cases
- **Low**: Backward compatibility testing needed
- **Low**: Tutorial ecosystem coordination
- **Low**: Course material impact assessment
- **Low**: Docker image implications
- **Low**: CI/CD pipeline updates needed

**Review Quality**:
```
✅ Exceptional architectural depth
✅ Comprehensive ecosystem analysis
✅ Long-term impact assessment
✅ Detailed migration strategies
✅ Risk mitigation planning
✅ Performance implications
✅ Security considerations
```

**Sample Output**:
> "This PR represents a fundamental shift in FastAPI's distribution strategy, moving from a monolithic approach to a modular architecture. While technically sound, it requires careful orchestration across the ecosystem:
> 
> **Architectural Impact**: The separation of core functionality from optional dependencies aligns with modern Python packaging practices but creates a potential fragmentation risk...
> 
> **Breaking Change Management**: This change affects every tutorial, course, and documentation referencing FastAPI installation. Recommend:
> 1. Coordinated release announcement across all channels
> 2. Migration timeline with deprecation warnings
> 3. Automated tooling to detect and suggest upgrades...
> 
> **Security Implications**: The new CLI module introduces additional attack surface through optional dependencies. Validation of the import chain and proper error handling prevents information disclosure...
> 
> **Performance Analysis**: The lazy loading approach reduces initial import time but may impact CLI startup. Benchmarking recommended for scenarios with frequent CLI invocation..."

**Best For**: Critical infrastructure changes, security-sensitive code, release planning
