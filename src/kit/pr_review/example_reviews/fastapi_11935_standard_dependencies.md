## PR Summary

This PR introduces a significant packaging change for FastAPI, moving from a "batteries-included" default installation to an opt-in approach for standard dependencies. The change allows users to install either:
- `pip install fastapi` (minimal installation)
- `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` (full experience with CLI and development tools)

## Kit AI Review Output

### Priority Issues

**Medium Priority**
- [fastapi/cli.py:12](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/main/fastapi/cli.py#L12): The error handling raises a RuntimeError after printing the message, which could be confusing in programmatic usage. Consider using a more specific exception type like `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**Low Priority**
- [tests/test_fastapi_cli.py:14](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/main/tests/test_fastapi_cli.py#L14): The test uses coverage run which adds complexity. Consider testing the CLI functionality more directly or documenting why coverage is needed here.

### Summary

This PR introduces a significant packaging change for FastAPI, moving from a "batteries-included" default installation to an opt-in approach for standard dependencies. Key changes include:

- **New installation pattern**: Users now install `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` for the full experience, while `pip install fastapi` provides a minimal installation
- **CLI integration**: Adds `python -m fastapi` support through new `__main__.py` and `cli.py` modules
- **Graceful degradation**: When CLI dependencies aren't available, provides clear error messages with installation instructions
- **Documentation updates**: Comprehensive updates across README and docs to reflect the new installation approach

The architectural change simplifies the core FastAPI package while maintaining backward compatibility through optional dependencies.

### Recommendations

**Error Handling Enhancement**
```python
# In fastapi/cli.py, consider using a more specific exception:
def main() -> None:
    if not cli_main:
        message = 'To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":\n\n\tpip install "fastapi[standard]"\n'
        print(message)
        raise ImportError(message) from None  # More semantically correct
```

**Test Coverage Improvement**
- Consider adding a test that verifies the CLI works when `fastapi-cli` is properly installed
- The current test only covers the error case and uses subprocess with coverage, which may be brittle

**Documentation Consistency**
- Verify that all code examples in tutorials and documentation are updated to use the new installation pattern
- Consider adding a migration guide for existing users

**Cross-codebase Impact**
- This change will affect all downstream projects and tutorials that reference FastAPI installation
- Consider coordinating with the ecosystem (tutorials, courses, etc.) for a smooth transition
- The change is well-documented but represents a significant shift in user experience

The implementation is solid and the graceful error handling for missing CLI dependencies is well-designed. The packaging simplification aligns with modern Python practices of minimal default installations with optional extras.
