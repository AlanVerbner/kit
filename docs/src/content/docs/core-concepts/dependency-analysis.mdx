import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The dependency analysis feature in `kit` allows you to map, visualize, and analyze the relationships between different components in your codebase. This helps you understand complex codebases, identify potential refactoring opportunities, detect circular dependencies, and prepare dependency context for large language models.

## Why Dependency Analysis?

Understanding dependencies in a codebase is crucial for:

- **Codebase Understanding:** Quickly grasp how different modules interact with each other.
- **Refactoring Planning:** Identify modules with excessive dependencies or cyclic relationships that might benefit from refactoring.
- **Technical Debt Assessment:** Map dependencies to visualize potential areas of technical debt or architectural concerns.
- **Impact Analysis:** Determine the potential impact of changes to specific components.
- **LLM Context Preparation:** Generate concise, structured descriptions of codebase architecture for LLM context.

## Getting Started

You can access the dependency analyzer through the `Repository` object:

```python
from kit import Repository

# Load your codebase
repo = Repository("/path/to/your/codebase")

# Get a language-specific dependency analyzer
# Currently supports 'python' and 'terraform'
analyzer = repo.get_dependency_analyzer('python')  # or 'terraform'

# Build the dependency graph
graph = analyzer.build_dependency_graph()

print(f"Found {len(graph)} components in the dependency graph")
```

## Exploring Dependencies

Once you've built the dependency graph, you can explore it in various ways:

```python
# Find cycles (circular dependencies)
cycles = analyzer.find_cycles()
if cycles:
    print(f"Found {len(cycles)} circular dependencies:")
    for cycle in cycles[:5]:
        print(f"  {' → '.join(cycle)} → {cycle[0]}")

# Get dependencies for a specific module
module_deps = analyzer.get_resource_dependencies('module_name')
print(f"Module depends on: {module_deps}")

# Get dependents (modules that depend on a specific module)
dependents = analyzer.get_dependents('module_name')
print(f"Modules that depend on this: {dependents}")
```

## Visualizing Dependencies

You can visualize the dependency graph using common formats like DOT, GraphML, or JSON:

```python
# Export to DOT format (for use with tools like Graphviz)
analyzer.export_dependency_graph(
    output_format="dot",
    output_path="dependency_graph.dot"
)

# Generate a PNG visualization
analyzer.visualize_dependencies(
    output_path="dependency_visualization.png",
    format="png"  # supports 'png', 'svg', or 'pdf'
)
```

<Aside type="note">
  Visualization requires the Graphviz software to be installed on your system.

## LLM Context Generation

One of the most powerful features of the dependency analyzer is its ability to generate concise, LLM-friendly context about your codebase structure:

```python
# Generate markdown context for LLMs
context = analyzer.generate_llm_context(
    output_format="markdown",
    output_path="dependency_context.md",
    max_tokens=4000  # approximate token limit
)
```

The generated context includes:
- Overall statistics (component count, type breakdown)
- Key components with high connectivity
- Circular dependency information
- Language-specific insights (e.g., import patterns for Python, resource relationships for Terraform)

## Language-Specific Features

### Python Dependency Analysis

The Python dependency analyzer maps import relationships between modules:

```python
# Get a Python-specific analyzer
python_analyzer = repo.get_dependency_analyzer('python')

# Build the graph
python_analyzer.build_dependency_graph()

# Find standard library vs. third-party dependencies
report = python_analyzer.generate_dependency_report()
print(f"Standard library imports: {len(report['standard_library_imports'])}")
print(f"Third-party imports: {len(report['third_party_imports'])}")
```

### Terraform Dependency Analysis

The Terraform dependency analyzer maps relationships between infrastructure resources:

```python
# Get a Terraform-specific analyzer
terraform_analyzer = repo.get_dependency_analyzer('terraform')

# Build the graph
terraform_analyzer.build_dependency_graph()

# Find all resources of a specific type
s3_buckets = terraform_analyzer.get_resource_by_type("aws_s3_bucket")
```

Each resource in the graph includes its absolute file path, making it easy to locate resources in complex infrastructure codebases:

```
aws_launch_template.app (aws_launch_template) [File: /path/to/your/project/compute.tf]
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Dependency Analysis

If you have specific needs for your dependency analysis, you can extend the base `DependencyAnalyzer` class to create analyzers for other languages or frameworks:

```python
from kit.dependency_analyzer import DependencyAnalyzer

class CustomDependencyAnalyzer(DependencyAnalyzer):
    # Implement required abstract methods
    def build_dependency_graph(self):
        # Your custom logic here
        pass
        
    def export_dependency_graph(self, output_format="json", output_path=None):
        # Your custom export logic here
        pass
        
    def find_cycles(self):
        # Your custom cycle detection logic here
        pass
        
    def visualize_dependencies(self, output_path, format="png"):
        # Your custom visualization logic here
        pass
```
